<h2>Project 2: RoR Full-stack CRUD Application</h2>

<h2>i. Kashi-Uta</h2>

Kashi-Uta is an online social community for sharing Romaji song lyrics. For the uninitiated, Romaji is the phonetic spelling of the Japanese language using the English alphabet. Registered users of the app can share their Romaji lyrics with site visitors and other members, while having the ability to edit or delete lyric posts at any time. The app is not only a community for the appreciation of Japanese music, but may also be used as a tool for learning the Japanese language.
